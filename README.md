# CSC520_Scheduler
Graduate Project: Uses local search techniques to create optimal class schedules.

Input file has a list of made up classes to use. The input file can be used to input which classes the user wishes to take, among things such as desired breaks.
Uses local hill climbing, as well as simulated annealing to create two possible schedules for the user. Simiulated annealing is far supperior in both error rate
and run time to hill climbing. May take 20 seconds or so to run due to local hill climbing run time.
